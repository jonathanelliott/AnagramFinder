# AnagramFinder

** This is a work in progress **

A Python library to find anagrams and other word-based facts in datasets.

Did you know that Tina Reynolds, who came seventh for Ireland in the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest, is the only entrant in the history of the competition whose name is an anagram of a World Snooker champion?

With this library you can find many such facts.
